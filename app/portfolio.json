                "abstract": "The reliance of organisations on computer networks is enabled by network programmability, which is typically achieved through Service Function Chaining. These chains virtualise network functions, link them, and programmatically embed them on networking infrastructure. Optimal embedding of Service Function Chains is an NP-hard problem, with three sub-problems, chain composition, virtual network function embedding, and link embedding, that have to be optimised simultaneously, rather than sequentially, for optimal results. Genetic Algorithms have been employed for this, but existing approaches either do not optimise all three sub-problems or do not optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We propose a Genetic Algorithm-based approach called GENESIS, which evolves three sine-function-activated Neural Networks, and funnels their output to a Gaussian distribution and an A* algorithm to optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We evaluate GENESIS on an emulator across 48 different data centre scenarios and compare its performance to two state-of-the-art Genetic Algorithms and one greedy algorithm. GENESIS produces an optimal solution for 100% of the scenarios, whereas the second-best method optimises only 71% of the scenarios. Moreover, GENESIS is the fastest among all Genetic Algorithms, averaging 15.84 minutes, compared to an average of 38.62 minutes for the second-best Genetic Algorithm.",

                "abstract": "Service Function Chains (SFCs) enable programmatic control of the functions and services in a computer network. By leveraging Software Defined Networking to control the links between virtualised network functions, SFCs provide a scalable approach to dealing with the increased pressures on network operation and management. Unfortunately, the challenge of embedding SFCs onto the underlying physical network and compute infrastructure is an NP-hard problem. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been used to address this issue, but they require significant time to evaluate solution quality (fitness) online, with most solutions instead adopting offline simulations or analytical evaluations. To enable online use of GAs in solving the SFC embedding problem, we introduce a hybrid online-offline approach to evaluate generated solutions. At the core of this is BeNNS--a topology, traffic, and SFC-embedding agnostic surrogate model that approximates fitness. We evaluate our approach across six experiments, varying available resources and traffic loads. Our results demonstrate that our approach is capable of exploring thousands of potential configurations and generating deployable solutions in 36.8 minutes on average, compared to online-only approaches, which take 17.9 hours on average to explore tens of solutions, which do not converge on an optimal solution.",

However, this also introduces new challenges, such as resource allocation and optimisation related to their operation, requiring new algorithms to address these challenges. Various tools have been used in the literature to evaluate these algorithms. However, these tools suffer from inaccuracy, low fidelity, unscalability, inflexibility, or additional code requirements. This paper introduces an emulator based on Mininet and Docker for SFCs called OpenRASE. The goal of OpenRASE is to enable the exploration of resource allocation algorithms for SFCs in a dynamic setting, allowing real CPU usage and latency to be measured. We describe the design and implementation of OpenRASE and discuss its characteristics. We also experimentally evaluate two different algorithms to address the SFC resource allocation challenge, including an online Genetic Algorithm, using OpenRASE to show its effectiveness and practicality for dynamic network conditions.",

This study analyzes existing literature on the applications of blockchain in the collective decision-making scenarios in swarm robotics. Consequently, this study introduces a novel taxonomy to study the different applications effectively. The taxonomy categorizes existing literature into (i) application of blockchain in other areas of swarm robotics, (ii) application of blockchain in continuous collective decision-making scenarios, (iii) application of blockchain in discrete collective decision-making scenarios, (iv) application of blockchain in other discrete collective decision-making scenarios, and (v) application of blockchain in the collective perception scenario.

                "abstract": "Batting teams get two resources in cricket to score runs with, viz. wickets and balls. Trying to score as many runs as possible off every ball a team faces risks losing wickets. Trying to preserve wickets comes at the cost of not enough runs being scored. Thus, to maximize the runs scored, teams need to make efficient use of the balls and wickets available to them. To that end, teams primarily employ two types of batsmen-aggressive batsmen who try to score as many runs as possible off the balls they face and defensive batsmen who try to protect their wickets. Having too many aggressive batsmen helps a team score more runs off the balls they face but it stands the risk of a team losing all its wickets before they face all of their allotted balls. Having too many defensive batsmen helps a team face all the balls allotted to them but they may not end up scoring enough runs. Hence, selecting the right combination of defensive and aggressive batsmen is essential to maximize the runs a batting team scores. However, this is a computationally complex problem to solve. This study proposes the use of genetic algorithm to optimize the batting lineup of a team to help it maximize the runs scored in an innings. The test results indicate, by using the genetic algorithm, the number of runs scored batting first by the full member teams in the last five years can be improved by 5.46% on average.",

Strategies that solve the consensus-achievement problem have been shown to be vulnerable to Byzantine robots. Blockchain-based solutions have been shown to improve Byzantine fault tolerance. However, these solutions suffer from poor performance, excessive resource consumption, and vulnerability to the 51% attack due to the use of the proof-of-work consensus algorithm. This study surveys existing blockchain consensus algorithms and their suitability to swarm robotics. Consequently, a taxonomy is introduced consisting of three categories, namely proof of resource, proof of authority, and Byzantine agreement. The proof-of-resource algorithms are vulnerable to the 51% attack and consume excess resources. Proof of authority algorithms creates permissioned blockchains, which contravenes the principles of swarm robotics. Byzantine agreement algorithms introduce centralisation.

Existing blockchain consensus algorithms used to create permissioned blockchains to not allow new validators to be dynamically added to the blockchain during runtime. This can be a problem when blockchain is used in swarm robotics, where redundancy is required. Besides, popular algorithms such as proof of work (PoW) that offer redundancy consume a lot of resources, making them unsuitable to run on the powerless robots used in swarm robotics. In addition, such algorithms are also vulnerable to threats such as the 51% attack. This research proposes a novel proof-of-identity (PoI) blockchain consensus algorithm to create a dynamically permissioned blockchain to be used in swarm robotics. This algorithm uses a swarm controller to generate a private-public key pair that is used to authorise validators. Tests carried out showed that the PoI algorithm is immune to the 51% attack threat and can run on low-powered devices such as Raspberry Pi 3. Moreover, the consensus time was also shown to be shorter in comparison to PoW.",

Thus, it becomes important for teams to calculate how many runs they should score off every over they face in an innings. The runs a team should score off an over is a function of the difficulty of scoring against the bowler bowling that over, the runs that have already been scored, the target, and the difficulty of scoring runs against the rest of the bowlers. However, the runs that can be scored in an over produces a state space with a branching factor of 37. Such a large state space makes using an uninformed search algorithm impractical.

Mainly in the ways of, achieving Disaster Recovery (DR) and in protecting the end users' data and Anywhere, Any device, Anytime access to the users' data. This research further helps people and organization to overcome common problems related to clouds such as, vendor-lock in and legal regulation. In today's world, more and more organizations are adopting the cloud services mainly because of the reliability and affordability provided by them. However, there are several drawbacks faced by the cloud users and cloud service providers. Apart from the security perspective, the cloud users are facing challenges in control and visibility, lack of standard service interfaces, difficulty in deploying applications across multiple clouds and vendor lock-in. Also, cloud service providers are facing challenges in degradation of the quality of service provided because of the distance between cloud data center and the end user and unexpected interruption of services etc. The above problems can be reduced to a greater extent or mitigated by adopting Multi Cross Cloud Infrastructure. This benefits the cloud users to receive the best quality services to increase their productivity. Hence, the main aim of this research is to build a common platform to manage the cross-cloud environment particularly Microsoft AZURE cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS) with multiple features such as policies based container migration among the clouds and finding the best virtual machines (VM) across the clouds to deploy new containers. Cross-cloud management platform can be implemented within an organization or Enterprise and is used by the 3rd level support team such as Infrastructure team to provide multiple services (E.g. - Delivering application containers, Migration of containers on request) to end users based on some service level agreements (SLA) with more control and visibility.",
